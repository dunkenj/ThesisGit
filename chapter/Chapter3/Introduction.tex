\section[SED]{Stellar masses}
The shape of a galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED) contains a wealth of information
A technique which has become increasingly popular with the growth of large multi-wavelength data sets is the use of spectral energy distributions to model the physical properties of galaxies 

The shape of a galaxy's SED is a result of almost every underlying physical
