The photometric redshift shown is the peak of the probability distribution ($\chi ^2$ minimum) with 1-$\sigma $ lower and upper limits. Of the 11 galaxies classed as outliers, 6 are low-redshift interlopes at $z < 3$.\relax }}{7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces The colours of our photometric redshift selected samples in relation to the two-colour cuts typically used to select Lyman break galaxies. Non-detections in a filter are converted to 2-$\sigma $ upper limits when calculating the colours. The shaded blue regions show the region in colour space used to select dropout galaxies in that redshift bin as described in \citet {2007ApJ...670..928B}. Red symbols represent galaxies selected in our sample by our selection criteria, where the transparency of the symbols is determined by the number of Monte Carlo samples in which it is selected i.e. the fainter the symbol, the smaller the fraction of MC samples that galaxy is selected in. Example error bars corresponding to 5-$\sigma $ detections (for both filters in a given colour) are shown for each of the corresponding drop-out colours.\relax }}{9}
