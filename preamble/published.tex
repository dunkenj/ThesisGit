\chapter*{Published Work}
Much of the work described in this thesis has been presented in the following papers:

\begin{enumerate}[I]
  \item Duncan, K.; Conselice, C. J.; Mortlock, A.; Hartley, W. G.; Guo, Y.; Ferguson, H. C.; Dav√©, R.; Lu, Y.; Ownsworth, J.; Ashby, M. L. N.; Dekel, A.; Dickinson, M.; Faber, S.; Giavalisco, M.; Grogin, N.; Kocevski, D.; Koekemoer, A.; Somerville, R. S.; White, C. E., \emph{``The mass evolution of the first galaxies: stellar mass functions and star formation rates at $4 < z < 7$ in the CANDELS GOODS-South field"}, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2014), Volume 444, Issue 3, p.2960-2984
  
  \item Duncan, K.; Conselice, C. J.; Mundy, C. J.; Lu, Y.; Guo, Y.; Ferguson, H. C. and the CANDELS collaboration, \emph{``Towards a complete history of galaxy assembly: Major merger rates at $2 \leq z \leq 6$ in the CANDELS fields"}, in preparation.
  
  \item Kenneth Duncan and Christopher J Conselice, \emph{``Powering reionization: assessing the galaxy ionizing photon budget at z < 10"}, submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2015)
\end{enumerate}

Paper I contains the work presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:smf} of this thesis. Chapter~\ref{ch:mergers} presents a subset of the analysis in Paper II which is currently a work in progress. Finally, Paper III presents the work described in Chapter~\ref{ch:reionization}.

The vast majority of the work presented in this thesis is the sole work of the author. This includes all photometric redshift, stellar mass estimation, SED modelling and completeness simulations. Exceptions to this are clearly outlined in the relevant sections and predominantly include the production of the photometric catalogs and semi-analytical models used in Chapters~\ref{ch:smf} and \ref{ch:mergers}. The methodology for the merger analysis presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:mergers} has been implemented in an equal collaborative effort with Carl J Mundy.
